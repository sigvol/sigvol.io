The Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science and Technology (CSST) 
program seeks to strengthen international collaboration by inviting highly 
accomplished students to study and engage in research at UCLA. 
The students are supported by institutional agreements with 
universities abroad and by scholarships from their home institutions. 

In this period of 3-months internship at UCLA, I developed a Hall Measurement System 
for semi-conductors. I designed the measurement circuit to take the test procedure 
automatically. Labview Programing was used to control the whole measurement procedure.
The system was calibrated using a variety of semi-conductor materials.
